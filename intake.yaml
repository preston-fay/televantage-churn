    Executive demo application showcasing AI-powered churn prediction and retention
    strategy optimization for ChurnIQ, a fictional #7 US telecom carrier with
    47.3M subscribers. Built to demonstrate Kearney's multi-agent AI orchestration
    capabilities and strategic insights derived from advanced churn modeling.

  - risk: "Scaling data 6,714x may produce unrealistic distributions"
    mitigation: "Validate scaled distributions match original percentages"

  - risk: "Dark theme readability issues (purple text on black)"
    mitigation: "Use white/gray text, purple only for accents"

  - risk: "Scenario calculations may be too slow in browser"
    mitigation: "Pre-calculate common scenarios, optimize JavaScript"

  - risk: "AWS Amplify deployment issues with Vite"
    mitigation: "Use proven amplify.yml pattern, test early"

  - risk: "2-week timeline is aggressive for 5 tabs + 7 charts"
    mitigation: "Use orchestrator workflow, focus on MVP first, polish later"

notes: |
  DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
  - "Label-first": Chart titles, axis labels, and legends are primary navigation
  - "Data-ink ratio": Minimize non-data elements (no gridlines, subtle axes)
  - "Executive-appropriate": Professional, serious, no gimmicks
  - "Accessible": High contrast, keyboard navigable, screen reader friendly
  - "Performance": Fast loading, smooth interactions, optimized assets

  BRAND COMPLIANCE:
  - Kearney purple (#7823DC) is an ACCENT color, not a text color
  - Use white (#FFFFFF) for headings, light gray (#E5E5E5) for body text
  - Pure black (#0A0A0A) background for maximum contrast
  - Inter font (Google Fonts, modern UI font with excellent readability)
  - NO gridlines (cleaner, more executive-friendly)
  - NO emojis (maintain professional tone)

  DATA SCALING APPROACH:
  1. Load telco-churn_v2 results (7,044 customers)
  2. Multiply customer counts by 6,714 (= 47.3M total)
  3. Keep percentages/rates identical (churn rate, targeting rate, etc.)
  4. Scale financial metrics (revenue, costs, savings)
  5. Aggregate to segment level (54 segments)
  6. Generate static JSON for demo

  SCENARIO CALCULATION LOGIC:
  - Contract Conversion: Reduces M2M churn by X%, costs $Y per conversion
  - Onboarding Excellence: Reduces 0-12mo churn by X%, costs $Y investment
  - Budget Optimization: Targets N customers, calculates ROI curve with diminishing returns
  - All scenarios use global economic assumptions (ARPU, LTV, margin, etc.)

  AGENTIC AI MESSAGING:
  - "Data Agent: Ingests 47.3M customer records, identifies 54 segments"
  - "ML Agent: Trains 6 models in parallel, selects best performer (LR, AUC 0.85)"
  - "Strategy Agent: Optimizes thresholds per segment, generates retention strategies"
  - "QA Agent: Validates results, approves for production deployment"
  - Value: AI handles 80% of work → consultants focus on strategic recommendations

  KEARNEY DIFFERENTIATION:
  - Traditional: 12-week engagement, static Excel, one-time insights, $2M cost
  - Kearney + AI: 2-week deployment, real-time intelligence, continuous optimization, $500K cost
  - Result: 6x faster, 4x cheaper, higher accuracy, adaptive strategies
