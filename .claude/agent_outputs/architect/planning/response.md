## Example Invocation

### Input from Orchestrator:
```markdown
# Project Brief: Task Management API

**Project Name:** TaskFlow API
**Objective:** Build a RESTful API for team task management with real-time collaboration

## Requirements
- User authentication and authorization (JWT-based)
- CRUD operations for tasks, projects, and teams
- Real-time updates when tasks change (WebSocket support)
- Task assignment and status tracking
- File attachments for tasks (up to 10MB)
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Audit log for all changes

## Constraints
- Must use existing PostgreSQL database infrastructure
- Budget limits hosting costs to $200/month initially
- Must support 1000 concurrent users
- API response time <200ms for 95th percentile
- Must be deployable on AWS
```

### Expected Output (Sample):

```markdown
# Architecture Proposal: TaskFlow API

## Executive Summary
TaskFlow API is designed as a modern, scalable RESTful API with real-time capabilities. The architecture follows a three-tier pattern with a Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and Redis for caching and pub/sub. The system uses WebSocket connections for real-time updates and implements JWT-based authentication. The design prioritizes horizontal scalability, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness within the $200/month budget constraint.

### Technology Stack
| Component          | Technology                | Rationale |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| API Framework     | Node.js + Express.js      | Fast, scalable, excellent async I/O for real-time features |
| Real-time Layer   | Socket.io                 | Robust WebSocket implementation with fallbacks |
| Database          | PostgreSQL 14+            | Required by constraints; supports JSONB for flexible schemas |
| Cache/Pub-Sub     | Redis 7.0                 | In-memory performance, pub/sub for real-time, cost-effective |
| Authentication    | JWT + bcrypt              | Stateless auth, industry standard, scalable |
| File Storage      | AWS S3                    | Cost-effective, scalable, integrates well with API |
| Hosting           | AWS EC2 (t3.small) + RDS  | Meets budget constraint, can scale as needed |

## Data Model

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Authentication, profile, team memberships
- **Teams**: Organization structure, member roles
- **Projects**: Task containers, team association
- **Tasks**: Core work items, assignments, status tracking
- **Attachments**: File metadata, S3 references
- **AuditLogs**: Change tracking for compliance

[... detailed schema would follow ...]
```

## Quality Guidelines

When creating architecture proposals:

1. **Be Comprehensive**: Address all requirements explicitly
2. **Justify Decisions**: Every technology choice needs a clear rationale
3. **Consider Trade-offs**: Document what was sacrificed and why
4. **Plan for Scale**: Consider growth paths and bottlenecks
5. **Security First**: Include authentication, authorization, data protection
6. **Cost Awareness**: Stay within budget constraints
7. **Maintainability**: Choose patterns that are well-documented and supportable
