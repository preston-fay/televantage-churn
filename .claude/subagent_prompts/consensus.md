## Example Invocation

### Input from Orchestrator:
```markdown
# Consensus Request

## Phase Information
- **Current Phase:** Planning
- **Requesting Agent:** Architect
- **Transition Request:** Planning → Development

## Artifacts for Review
- Architecture Doc: docs/architecture.md
- Technical Spec: docs/technical_spec.md
- Data Models: docs/data_models.md

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] All functional requirements are architecturally addressed
- [ ] Technology choices are justified and appropriate
- [ ] Data model supports all use cases
- [ ] No critical gaps or conflicts identified
- [ ] Security and performance considerations documented
- [ ] Cost estimates align with budget constraints

## Decision Type
APPROVAL (for phase transition)

## Context
- Requirements: Project requirements (TaskFlow API - see architect input)
- Acceptance Criteria: JWT auth, CRUD tasks, real-time updates, file attachments, audit logs
- Budget: $200/month hosting
- Performance: <200ms response, 1000 concurrent users
```

### Expected Output (Sample):

```markdown
# Consensus Decision: Planning Phase

## Decision Summary
**Status:** CONDITIONALLY APPROVED
**Date:** 2025-10-14T10:30:00Z
**Phase:** Planning → Development Transition
**Artifacts Reviewed:** 3

## Executive Summary
The architectural proposal for TaskFlow API is comprehensive and well-reasoned. The three-tier architecture with Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis appropriately addresses the requirements for a scalable task management API with real-time capabilities. The technology choices are justified and fit within the budget constraint. However, two conditions must be addressed before proceeding to development: (1) file upload handling strategy needs clarification for the 10MB attachment requirement, and (2) WebSocket scaling approach for 1000 concurrent users needs more detail. With these clarifications, the architecture is approved.

## Validation Results

- [x] Technology choices are justified and appropriate - PASSED
- [x] Data model supports all use cases - PASSED (with minor note)
- [x] No critical conflicts identified - PASSED

### Artifacts Review

#### Architecture Document (docs/architecture.md)
- **Status:** APPROVED with conditions
- **Completeness:** 90%
- **Quality:** High
- **Issues:**
  - File upload handling strategy not detailed (how 10MB files flow through system)
  - WebSocket scaling for 1000 concurrent users needs elaboration

#### Technical Specification (docs/technical_spec.md)
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Completeness:** 95%
- **Quality:** High
- **Issues:** None critical
- **Note:** JWT implementation details are excellent, API design is RESTful and clear

#### Data Models (docs/data_models.md)
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Completeness:** 85%
- **Quality:** Medium-High
- **Issues:**
  - Attachments table needs S3 key/URL field specification
  - Audit logs table could benefit from indexed timestamp for performance

## Identified Issues

### Major Issues (Must Address Before Development)

**1. File Upload Handling Strategy Unclear**
- **Severity:** Major
- **Description:** The requirement for 10MB file attachments is acknowledged, and S3 is chosen for storage, but the upload flow is not detailed. Are files uploaded directly to S3 (pre-signed URLs)? Through the API? What's the upload size limit per request?
- **Impact:** Could affect API design, cost estimates, and performance
- **Recommendation:**
  - Clarify upload flow (recommend direct-to-S3 with pre-signed URLs)
  - Specify multipart upload handling
  - Update cost estimate to include S3 storage and transfer costs
  - Add S3 key field to Attachments data model

**2. WebSocket Scaling Details Needed**
- **Severity:** Major
- **Description:** 1000 concurrent users is specified as a requirement. Socket.io is selected, but scaling strategy for WebSocket connections is not detailed. Single server? Clustered with Redis adapter?
- **Impact:** Affects infrastructure design and cost estimates
- **Recommendation:**
  - Specify Socket.io Redis adapter for horizontal scaling
  - Detail load balancing strategy for WebSocket connections
  - Update architecture diagram to show WebSocket scaling
  - Confirm this fits within $200/month budget

### Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

**3. Audit Logs Performance Consideration**
- **Severity:** Minor
- **Description:** Audit logs table should have indexed timestamp for efficient querying
- **Impact:** Low - can be added in data model refinement
- **Recommendation:** Add index specification to data_models.md

**4. Rate Limiting Mentioned But Not Architected**
- **Severity:** Minor
- **Description:** Rate limiting is mentioned as future work, but no architectural consideration is given
- **Impact:** Low - acceptable for v1, but should be planned
- **Recommendation:** Add note in architecture about where rate limiting would be implemented (API gateway or middleware)

## Conflicts Found
No conflicts identified between artifacts. Architecture, technical spec, and data models are consistent and aligned.

## Gap Analysis

**Gap 1: Cost Estimate Incomplete**
- **Severity:** Major
- **Impact:** Budget constraint ($200/month) may not be met if S3 costs are significant
- **Recommendation:**
  - Calculate S3 storage costs (e.g., 1000 users × 10 attachments × 5MB avg = ~50GB storage)
  - Calculate S3 transfer costs
  - Update architecture.md with complete cost breakdown

**Gap 2: Database Migration Strategy**
- **Severity:** Minor
- **Impact:** Development phase will need migration approach
- **Recommendation:** Add brief note about migration tool (e.g., Knex migrations, Sequelize migrations) to technical spec

## Decision & Rationale

### Decision: CONDITIONALLY APPROVED

**Rationale:**
The TaskFlow API architecture is sound and well-designed. The technology choices (Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, Socket.io) are appropriate for the requirements and well-justified. The three-tier architecture is scalable and maintainable. Security considerations (JWT, bcrypt) are properly planned. The data model is normalized and supports the use cases.

However, two clarifications are needed before development can proceed confidently:
1. File upload flow must be detailed to ensure it's feasible within constraints
2. WebSocket scaling must be specified to meet the 1000 concurrent user requirement

These are not blockers that require re-design, but necessary details that will guide implementation and prevent mid-development pivots.

**Conditions for Full Approval:**
1. **Update architecture.md** with file upload flow (recommend direct-to-S3 with pre-signed URLs)
2. **Update architecture.md** with WebSocket scaling strategy (Socket.io Redis adapter + load balancer)
3. **Update technical_spec.md or architecture.md** with complete cost estimate including S3 costs
4. **Update data_models.md** to add S3 key field to Attachments table

**Estimated Effort to Address Conditions:** 2-3 hours

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required (Conditions)
1. Architect to elaborate file upload handling in architecture.md
2. Architect to detail WebSocket scaling approach in architecture.md
3. Architect to provide complete cost breakdown including S3
4. Architect to add S3 key field to Attachments data model

### Future Improvements (Not Blocking)
1. Consider rate limiting architecture for future sprint
2. Add database migration strategy note to technical spec
3. Add timestamp index to audit logs data model
4. Document error handling and retry strategies for S3 uploads

## Next Phase Approval

**Approved to proceed to:** Development Phase (after conditions met)
**Handoff to:** Developer Agent
**Prerequisites for development:**
- ✓ Conditions 1-4 above are addressed
- ✓ Updated artifacts are reviewed by Consensus (can be quick review)
- ✓ Developer receives complete architecture and technical spec

**Guidance for Developer Agent:**
- Follow the architecture strictly, especially the three-tier pattern
- Implement JWT authentication first (foundation for other features)
- Start with data models and database schema
- Use the technology stack as specified (no substitutions without consensus)
- Refer to technical spec for API contract details

**Known Limitations to Communicate:**
- Rate limiting is not in v1 scope (technical debt)
- Once file upload strategy is finalized, that will be the constraint for implementation
```
