## Example Invocation

### Input from Orchestrator:
```markdown
# QA Request

## Artifacts to Test
- Source Code: src/auth/
- Existing Tests: tests/auth/
- Implementation Notes: docs/implementation_notes.md

## Requirements & Acceptance Criteria
**Feature:** User Authentication API
**Spec Document:** docs/technical_spec.md

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] POST /api/auth/register - Create new user account
- [ ] POST /api/auth/login - Authenticate user and return JWT
- [ ] POST /api/auth/refresh - Refresh expired access token
- [ ] Password hashing using bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- [ ] JWT tokens expire after 15 minutes (access) and 7 days (refresh)
- [ ] Return 401 for invalid credentials
- [ ] Return 400 for validation errors with detailed messages
- [ ] All endpoints have unit tests with >90% coverage

## Quality Standards
- Test Coverage: Minimum 90%
- Performance: Response time <100ms for auth endpoints
- Security: No plaintext passwords, secure token generation

## Testing Scope
- [x] Functional Testing
- [x] Integration Testing
- [x] Performance Testing
- [x] Security Testing
```

### Expected Output (Sample):

```markdown
# QA Report: User Authentication API

## Executive Summary
**Status:** PASS WITH MINOR ISSUES
**Test Coverage:** 96%
**Critical Issues:** 0
**Major Issues:** 0
**Minor Issues:** 2

The User Authentication API implementation meets all acceptance criteria and quality standards. Test coverage exceeds the 90% minimum requirement. Performance benchmarks are well within acceptable limits. Two minor issues were identified related to error message consistency and rate limiting, but these do not block release.

## Test Execution Summary
- **Total Test Cases:** 47
- **Passed:** 45 (95.7%)
- **Failed:** 2 (4.3%) - Minor issues only
- **Skipped:** 0 (0%)

### Test Categories
- Unit Tests: 38/38 passed (100%)
- Integration Tests: 7/7 passed (100%)
- Security Tests: 2/2 passed (100%)
- Performance Tests: 0/0 passed (see performance validation below)

## Acceptance Criteria Validation
- [x] POST /api/auth/register - Create new user account - **PASSED**
- [x] POST /api/auth/login - Authenticate user and return JWT - **PASSED**
- [x] POST /api/auth/refresh - Refresh expired access token - **PASSED**
- [x] Password hashing using bcrypt (cost factor 12) - **PASSED** (verified in code review)
- [x] JWT tokens expire correctly - **PASSED** (access: 15min, refresh: 7 days)
- [x] Return 401 for invalid credentials - **PASSED**
- [x] Return 400 for validation errors with messages - **PASSED** (minor inconsistency noted)
- [x] Test coverage >90% - **PASSED** (96% actual)

## Issues Found

### Minor Issues

**1. Inconsistent Error Message Format**
- **Severity:** Minor
- **Description:** Validation error messages use different formats across endpoints (some return array, some return object)
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. POST /api/auth/register with missing email field
  2. POST /api/auth/login with missing password field
  3. Compare error response structures
- **Expected:** Consistent error format across all endpoints
- **Actual:** Registration returns `{errors: [{field, message}]}` but login returns `{error: {message}}`
- **Recommendation:** Standardize on array format for consistency
- **Impact:** Low - doesn't affect functionality, only DX

**2. Missing Rate Limiting**
- **Severity:** Minor (noted in technical debt)
- **Description:** No rate limiting implemented on authentication endpoints
- **Security Implication:** Potential for brute force attacks on login endpoint
- **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting (e.g., 5 attempts per minute per IP)
- **Impact:** Medium security concern, but acceptable for v1 release with monitoring
- **Note:** Already documented in implementation notes as technical debt

## Quality Metrics

### Code Coverage
- **Overall:** 96% (exceeds 90% minimum ✓)
- **auth/authController.js:** 95%
- **auth/authService.js:** 98%
- **auth/authMiddleware.js:** 100%
- **models/User.js:** 92%

### Performance Validation
| Endpoint | P50 | P95 | P99 | Target | Status |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|--------|--------|
| POST /auth/register | 45ms | 78ms | 95ms | <100ms | ✓ PASS |
| POST /auth/login | 52ms | 81ms | 98ms | <100ms | ✓ PASS |
| POST /auth/refresh | 12ms | 24ms | 35ms | <100ms | ✓ PASS |

**Load Testing Results:**
- Concurrent Users: 100
- Duration: 5 minutes
- Total Requests: 15,234
- Success Rate: 100%
- Average Response Time: 58ms

### Security Validation
- [x] Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes (cost factor 12 confirmed)
- [x] No plaintext passwords in logs or responses
- [x] JWT secrets properly configured from environment
- [x] SQL injection protection (parameterized queries confirmed)
- [x] XSS protection (input sanitization confirmed)
- [x] CSRF tokens not required for stateless JWT auth
- [ ] Rate limiting not implemented (documented as minor issue)

### Edge Cases Tested
- [x] Malformed JWT tokens
- [x] Expired tokens
- [x] Token signature validation
- [x] Missing required fields
- [x] Invalid email formats
- [x] Weak passwords (minimum requirements)
- [x] Duplicate user registration
- [x] Case sensitivity in email/username
- [x] Unicode characters in inputs
- [x] SQL injection attempts
- [x] XSS payload attempts

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Recommended for v1)
1. **Standardize Error Response Format**
   - Effort: 2 hours
   - Impact: Improves API consistency and developer experience
   - Risk: Low

### Priority 2 (Acceptable for v1.1)
2. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - Effort: 4 hours
   - Impact: Reduces brute force attack surface
   - Risk: Low (can deploy with monitoring initially)

3. **Add Email Verification Flow**
   - Effort: 1 day
   - Impact: Prevents fake account creation
   - Risk: Low (feature enhancement, not critical for v1)

## Release Readiness

**Recommendation:** ✅ **CONDITIONAL APPROVE**

**Rationale:**
The implementation meets all acceptance criteria and quality standards. The two identified issues are minor and do not block release:

1. Error message inconsistency affects DX but not functionality
2. Rate limiting is documented technical debt with acceptable risk for v1

**Conditions for Approval:**
- Fix error message format inconsistency (2 hour effort)
- Deploy with monitoring for auth endpoint abuse
- Plan rate limiting implementation for v1.1 (next sprint)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Functionality Risk:** Low - all tests pass, coverage excellent
- **Performance Risk:** Low - well within targets under load
- **Security Risk:** Low-Medium - no critical vulnerabilities, rate limiting recommended for v1.1
- **Overall Risk:** Low - safe to release with monitoring

**Approval Status:** ✅ Approved for release after error format fix
```
