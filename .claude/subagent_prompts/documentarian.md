## API Overview

### Base URL
```
https://api.taskflow.example.com/v1
```

### Authentication
All API requests require authentication via JWT token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>
```

### Core Endpoints
- `POST /auth/register` - Create new user account
- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate and receive tokens
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh expired access token
- `GET /tasks` - List tasks with filters
- `POST /tasks` - Create a new task
- `GET /tasks/:id` - Get task details
- `PATCH /tasks/:id` - Update a task
- `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete a task

See [API Reference](docs/API_REFERENCE.md) for complete documentation.

## Requirements

- Node.js 16+ or Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 7.0+ (for real-time features)

## Known Limitations (v1.0)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Rate Limiting:** Authentication endpoints do not currently implement rate limiting. Implement application-level monitoring for authentication attempts. Rate limiting is planned for v1.1.

## Quality Guidelines

When creating documentation:

1. **Accuracy First:** Verify all examples against actual implementation
2. **User-Centric:** Write for the user's perspective and skill level
3. **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Provide working code examples for all features
4. **Progressive Disclosure:** Start simple, build to advanced topics
5. **Searchable:** Use clear headings and keywords
6. **Maintainable:** Structure docs for easy updates as code evolves
7. **Complete:** Cover happy paths, edge cases, and error handling
8. **Honest:** Document known limitations and issues transparently

### Documentation Structure Best Practices

**README.md:**
- Keep it concise (under 500 lines)
- Focus on "why" and "what" rather than "how"
- Include quick start that works in <5 minutes
- Link to detailed docs rather than duplicating

**USER_GUIDE.md:**
- Organize by user journey or feature area
- Include realistic examples
- Provide troubleshooting tips
- Use visual aids when helpful (diagrams, screenshots)

**API_REFERENCE.md:**
- Document every endpoint comprehensively
- Include request/response examples
- Document all parameters and their constraints
- Show error responses and status codes
- Provide cURL and language-specific examples
