# ==============================================================================
# RAISE FRAMEWORK
# ==============================================================================

raise_framework:
  overview: >
    RAISE is Kearney's framework for ensuring insights are actionable and impactful.
    Every analysis, finding, and recommendation should pass the RAISE test.

  principles:
    relevant:
      definition: "Directly addresses the client's key questions and business priorities"
      questions:
        - "Does this insight relate to a decision the client needs to make?"
        - "Is this tied to a business outcome (revenue, cost, risk, growth)?"
        - "Would the client care if this finding were different?"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Interesting but tangential analyses (analyst curiosity, not client need)"
        - "Generic insights not specific to client's context"
        - "Overly technical details that don't inform decisions"
      best_practices:
        - "Anchor every analysis to a specific client question or hypothesis"
        - "Prioritize analyses by potential business impact"
        - "Ask: 'So what?' - if you can't answer compellingly, revisit relevance"

    actionable:
      definition: "Provides clear implications and next steps the client can take"
      questions:
        - "What should the client do differently based on this insight?"
        - "Is the recommendation specific enough to act on?"
        - "Do we provide a clear path forward?"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Insights that are interesting but don't suggest action"
        - "Vague recommendations ('optimize operations', 'improve customer experience')"
        - "Findings without implications ('Sales declined 15%' - OK, now what?)"
      best_practices:
        - "Every chart should have a 'so what' message that drives action"
        - "Recommendations should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)"
        - "Provide implementation guidance, not just strategic direction"
        - "Include quick wins and longer-term initiatives"

    insightful:
      definition: "Goes beyond the obvious; reveals something the client didn't already know"
      questions:
        - "Is this insight surprising or non-obvious?"
        - "Does this challenge conventional wisdom or reveal hidden patterns?"
        - "Does this provide a new lens on the problem?"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Confirming what everyone already believes without new evidence"
        - "Restating data without synthesis or interpretation"
        - "Surface-level observations that don't explain 'why'"
      best_practices:
        - "Look for counter-intuitive findings (the 'aha!' moments)"
        - "Segment and drill down to find variation (national averages hide regional differences)"
        - "Compare against benchmarks or expectations to show what's surprising"
        - "Use 'root cause' thinking to go deeper than symptoms"

    supported:
      definition: "Backed by rigorous data and sound analytical methodology"
      questions:
        - "Is the data source credible and sufficiently comprehensive?"
        - "Is the analytical approach valid and appropriate?"
        - "Are alternative explanations considered and ruled out?"
        - "Can the findings withstand scrutiny?"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Cherry-picking data to support a pre-determined conclusion"
        - "Using anecdotes or small samples to make broad claims"
        - "Correlation presented as causation without justification"
        - "Ignoring data quality issues or limitations"
      best_practices:
        - "Document data sources, sample sizes, time periods"
        - "Acknowledge limitations and caveats"
        - "Use multiple data sources to triangulate findings"
        - "Apply statistical rigor (significance tests, confidence intervals)"
        - "Consider alternative hypotheses and test them"

    engaging:
      definition: "Communicated in a clear, compelling, and visually effective way"
      questions:
        - "Can the audience quickly grasp the key message?"
        - "Is the visualization the right choice for the data?"
        - "Is the narrative logical and easy to follow?"
        - "Does the presentation hold attention and drive to action?"
      anti_patterns:
        - "Dense slides with too much text or data"
        - "Confusing or misleading charts"
        - "Lack of clear storyline or message hierarchy"
        - "Jargon-heavy language that alienates the audience"
      best_practices:
        - "One key message per slide (pyramid principle)"
        - "Use the right chart for the data (see visualization_standards below)"
        - "Lead with the headline, support with data"
        - "Use visual hierarchy (size, color, position) to guide the eye"
        - "Tell a story with beginning (context), middle (analysis), end (recommendation)"

# ==============================================================================
# PRESENTATION STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

presentation_standards:
  slide_design:
    font:
      standard: "Arial"
      title: "Arial Bold, 20-24pt"
      body: "Arial Regular, 12-14pt"
      footnotes: "Arial Regular, 8-10pt"
      why: "Clean, professional, universally readable"
      exceptions: "Client-specific brand guidelines may override"

    color_palette:
      primary: "Kearney blue (#003A70)"
      secondary: "Kearney light blue (#00A3E0)"
      accent_colors: "Use sparingly for emphasis (red for negative, green for positive)"
      neutral: "Grays for supporting information"
      avoid: "Default PowerPoint colors (garish, unprofessional)"

    layout:
      title_placement: "Top-left or centered, depending on template"
      white_space: "Generous margins, avoid cramming content"
      alignment: "Left-aligned text, centered charts"
      consistency: "Same layout structure across similar slides"

    gridlines_and_clutter:
      gridlines: "NO GRIDLINES (unless absolutely necessary for precision reading)"
      rationale: "Gridlines add visual noise; data should be labeled directly"
      borders: "Minimal use; avoid boxing every element"
      backgrounds: "White or light neutral (no busy backgrounds)"

  chart_design:
    label_first_approach:
      principle: "Label data directly on or near visual elements, not in a separate legend"
      rationale: "Reduces cognitive load; viewer doesn't have to match colors to legend"
      examples:
        - "Label bars directly with values"
        - "Annotate line chart series at their endpoints"
        - "Use callout boxes for key data points"
      when_legends_ok: "Many series (>5), color coding is intuitive (heatmaps)"

    chart_selection:
      comparison:
        - "Bar charts: Compare categories (horizontal bars for long labels)"
        - "Column charts: Compare time periods or ordered categories"
        - "Grouped/stacked bars: Compare sub-categories (max 3-4 groups)"

      composition:
        - "Pie chart: Show parts of whole (max 5 slices, avoid 3D)"
        - "Stacked bar/column: Parts of whole over time or categories"
        - "Waterfall chart: Show cumulative effect of sequential values"

      distribution:
        - "Histogram: Show distribution of continuous variable"
        - "Box plot: Compare distributions across groups"
        - "Violin plot: Show full distribution shape"

      relationship:
        - "Scatter plot: Show correlation between two variables"
        - "Bubble chart: Add third dimension via size"
        - "Heatmap: Show correlation matrix or two-way tables"

      trend:
        - "Line chart: Show change over time (continuous)"
        - "Area chart: Show cumulative trends"
        - "Sparklines: Small inline trends"

      avoid:
        - "3D charts (distort perception)"
        - "Dual-axis charts (can mislead, use only if necessary with clear labeling)"
        - "Pie charts with >5 slices (use bar chart instead)"
        - "Radar charts (hard to read, use table or bar chart)"

    axis_and_scale:
      y_axis_zero: "Start at zero for bar charts (or clearly indicate break)"
      axis_labels: "Clear, concise units (%, $M, thousands)"
      tick_marks: "Minimal, round numbers"
      logarithmic_scale: "Only when necessary and clearly labeled"

    color_usage:
      highlight: "Use color to emphasize key data points, not decorate"
      consistency: "Same color for same category across slides"
      accessibility: "Avoid red-green combinations (colorblind-friendly)"
      gradient: "Use for continuous scales (heatmaps), not categorical"

  slide_titles:
    headline_approach:
      principle: "Title states the conclusion, not the topic"
      good: "'Revenue growth accelerated in Q4 driven by premium segment'"
      bad: "'Revenue analysis'"
      why: "Busy executives skim titles - make titles self-sufficient"

    action_titles:
      when: "Recommendation slides"
      format: "'We recommend X to achieve Y'"
      example: "'Expand into Southeast Asia to capture $50M opportunity'"

  data_citations:
    requirement: "Every chart must cite its data source"
    format: "'Source: Client transaction data (Jan-Dec 2024), Kearney analysis'"
    placement: "Bottom-left or bottom-right footnote, 8-10pt font"
    level_of_detail: "Specific enough to verify, concise enough to read"

  appendix_usage:
    when_to_use:
      - "Supporting detail not essential to main narrative"
      - "Methodology and assumptions"
      - "Sensitivity analyses and alternative scenarios"
      - "Detailed data tables"
    structure: "Clearly labeled, easy to reference from main deck"

# ==============================================================================
# CLIENT ENGAGEMENT PRINCIPLES
# ==============================================================================

client_engagement:
  hypothesis_driven_approach:
    overview: "Structure work around testable hypotheses, not open-ended exploration"
    workflow:
      1: "Understand client's problem and frame key questions"
      2: "Develop hypotheses (what we believe the answer might be)"
      3: "Design analyses to test hypotheses"
      4: "Gather data and conduct tests"
      5: "Confirm, refute, or refine hypotheses"
      6: "Synthesize findings into recommendations"
    benefits:
      - "Focuses effort on high-impact questions"
      - "Builds client confidence (we have a point of view)"
      - "Enables iterative refinement (wrong hypotheses guide next steps)"

  pyramid_principle:
    overview: "Structure communication top-down: answer first, supporting arguments second"
    framework:
      - "Start with the answer (executive summary, recommendation)"
      - "Support with 3-4 key arguments (MECE: mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive)"
      - "Each argument supported by data and sub-points"
    application:
      - "Slide deck: Key message on first slide, details follow"
      - "Written reports: Executive summary first, methodology last"
      - "Verbal updates: 'Bottom line up front' (BLUF)"

  mece_principle:
    definition: "Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive"
    mutually_exclusive: "Categories don't overlap (no double-counting)"
    collectively_exhaustive: "Categories cover all possibilities (nothing left out)"
    examples:
      good: "Segment customers by: New, Returning, Churned (MECE)"
      bad: "Segment customers by: High-value, Frequent buyers, At-risk (overlaps)"
    why_it_matters: "Clear thinking, no gaps or overlaps in analysis"

  80_20_rule:
    principle: "Focus on the 20% of analyses that drive 80% of impact"
    application:
      - "Prioritize high-impact, high-feasibility recommendations"
      - "Don't get lost in minutiae; focus on what moves the needle"
      - "Quick pilots over perfect analyses (test and learn)"
    when_to_go_deep: "Core strategic questions, irreversible decisions, high-stakes risks"

  client_collaboration:
    working_sessions:
      - "Co-create hypotheses and analyses with client teams"
      - "Build buy-in through involvement, not just presenting results"
      - "Leverage client's institutional knowledge"
    feedback_loops:
      - "Share interim findings early and often (no big reveals)"
      - "Iterate based on client input"
      - "Manage expectations (what's in scope, what's not)"
    stakeholder_management:
      - "Identify decision-makers and influencers"
      - "Tailor communication to audience (CFO vs CMO vs frontline)"
      - "Build coalition for change (champions, skeptics, blockers)"
