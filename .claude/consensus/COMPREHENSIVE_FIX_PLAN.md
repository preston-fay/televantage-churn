## Investigation Summary

I've completed a systematic investigation using Task agents and sequential thinking. Here are ALL the issues identified:

### 1. **Purple Text Accessibility Violations** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Found**: 27 violations across 4 files
**Problem**: Purple text (#7823DC, #C8A5F0) on dark backgrounds violates WCAG AA contrast standards
**Impact**: Unreadable text, poor user experience

**Affected Files**:
- `ExecutiveDashboard.tsx` - 1 critical (line 97: performance status)
- `ModelingDeepDive.tsx` - 4 critical (lines 274, 303, 332: archetype churn rates; line 556: feature importance)
- `SegmentExplorer.tsx` - 1 critical (line 363: ROI metric)
- `AgenticWorkflow.tsx` - 8 high, 6 medium (table cells, bullet points, icons)

**Fix Strategy**:
- Change ALL purple text to white (#FFFFFF) or light gray (#E5E5E5)
- Purple should ONLY be used for backgrounds, borders, and accent elements
- Never use purple for primary content text on dark backgrounds

### 2. **Missing Logo** ⚠️ HIGH
**Status**: Specification found but not implemented
**Found**: Component hierarchy docs show "Logo" as child of Header
**Current**: Text-only header, no logo component

**Questions for User**:
1. Which logo(s) to display?
   - Kearney logo (consulting firm)?
   - TeleVantage logo (fictional client)?
   - Both logos (co-branding)?
2. Where is the logo file located?
3. Placement: Top-left? Center? Replace text or accompany it?

### 3. **Waterfall Chart Labels Cut Off** ⚠️ HIGH
**Location**: `ExecutiveDashboard.tsx` - "Retention Economics Opportunity" chart
**Problem**:
- X-axis labels rotated -35 degrees (line 168 in WaterfallChart.tsx)
- Labels are anchored at "end" causing cutoff
- Third column "$7.58B" label completely missing
- Bottom margin (60px) insufficient for rotated text

**Fix**:
```typescript
// WaterfallChart.tsx, line 30
const margin = { top: 20, right: 30, bottom: 90, left: 80 };  // Increase bottom to 90px

// Lines 165-168 - Make labels horizontal instead of rotated
.selectAll('text')
  .attr('fill', '#A5A5A5')
  .attr('font-size', '11px')
  .attr('font-family', 'Inter, sans-serif')
  .style('text-anchor', 'middle')  // Change from 'end' to 'middle'
  .attr('dy', '1em');              // Remove rotation, use vertical offset
  // REMOVE: .attr('dx', '-0.8em')
  // REMOVE: .attr('transform', 'rotate(-35)')
```

### 4. **Unrealistic Baseline Scenarios** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Location**: `ScenarioPlanner.tsx` - ALL 3 scenario baselines
**Problem**: Shows "$0" retention budget, "0" customers targeted, "n/a" ROI
**User Feedback**: "DO YOU REALLY THINK TELEVANTAGE SPENDS ZERO? THIS MAKES NO SENSE"

**Current Code** (Lines 237, 395, 547):
```typescript
<div className="text-3xl font-bold text-text-secondary">$0</div>
<div className="text-2xl font-bold text-text-secondary">0</div>
<div className="text-2xl font-bold text-text-secondary">n/a</div>
```

**Fix Strategy** - Establish Realistic Baseline:
Based on industry standards for #7 US carrier (47.3M customers):

**Scenario 1 Baseline (Budget Optimization)**:
- Retention Budget: $75M/year (typical: $10-20 per high-risk customer)
- Customers Targeted: ~5M (10% of base, reactive approach)
- Annual Churn Cost: $1.42B (existing metric)
- Annual Savings: $150M (current reactive program performance)
- ROI: +100% (typical for reactive programs)

**Scenario 2 Baseline (Contract Conversion)**:
- Conversion Rate: 5% (typical passive conversion without incentives)
- Conversions: ~1M customers
- Churn Reduction: ~130K/year
- Annual Savings: $45M
- ROI: +50%

**Scenario 3 Baseline (Onboarding Excellence)**:
- Churn Reduction: 10% (minimal onboarding investment)
- Early Customers: 11.8M (0-3 months)
- Customers Saved: ~470K/year
- Annual Savings: $168M
- 3-Year NPV: $450M

**Implementation**:
- Add constants for baseline metrics
- Create separate component/section for "Current State (Without AI)"
- Show clear comparison: "Current Reactive Approach" vs "AI-Powered Proactive Approach"
- Update copy to emphasize upgrade from existing program, not starting from zero

### 5. **AI Workflow Not Linked to Scenarios** ⚠️ HIGH
**Location**: `AgenticWorkflow.tsx` and `ScenarioPlanner.tsx`
**Problem**: AI Workflow tab is completely disconnected from scenario outcomes
**User Feedback**: "THE AI WORKFLOW IS JUST TERRIBLE. IT'S NOT AT ALL LINKED TO THE SCENARIOS"

**Current State**:
- AI Workflow is static, generic pipeline description
- No connection to specific scenario calculations
- No interactive elements
- "View AI Workflow" buttons exist in ScenarioPlanner but open slide-out panel with generic content

**Fix Strategy**:
1. **Dynamic Workflow Panel** (Already exists in ScenarioPlanner.tsx lines 651-780):
   - Already shows scenario-specific agent descriptions
   - Already dynamically updates based on activeScenario state
   - **This is actually GOOD** - just needs better discoverability

2. **Enhance AI Workflow Tab**:
   - Add "View Live Examples in Scenario Planner" buttons
   - Show real scenario numbers in agent output examples
   - Add visual flow diagram connecting agents to scenario outcomes
   - Create cross-tab navigation (click scenario → jump to Scenario Planner)

3. **Add Scenario Impact Section to AI Workflow Tab**:
```markdown
## How These Agents Power Real Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Budget Optimization
[Show agent flow with actual numbers]
Data Agent → ML Agent → Strategy Agent → QA Agent
Result: $571M savings, 240% ROI

### Scenario 2: Contract Conversion
[Show agent flow with actual numbers]
...

### Scenario 3: Onboarding Excellence
[Show agent flow with actual numbers]
...
```

### 6. **Prediction Accuracy (AUC) on Executive Dashboard** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Location**: `ExecutiveDashboard.tsx` - Metric card showing "Prediction Accuracy (AUC) 85.0%"
**Problem**: User questions if this belongs on executive dashboard

**Options**:
A. **Remove entirely** - Too technical for C-suite
B. **Replace with business metric** - "At-Risk Customers Identified" or "Intervention Success Rate"
C. **Move to Analytics tab** - Keep for technical audience
D. **Keep but reframe** - Change label to "Model Confidence" with business explanation

**Recommendation**: **Option B** - Replace with "Intervention Success Rate: 72%" (more actionable)

Reasoning:
- Executives care about business outcomes, not model metrics
- AUC is a technical ML metric that requires explanation
- Success rate is immediately understandable
- Shows actual business value delivered

## Prioritized Fix Order

### Phase 1: Critical User Experience (Do First)
1. **Fix 27 purple text violations** (30 min) - Accessibility critical
2. **Fix unrealistic baselines** (45 min) - User is frustrated about this
3. **Fix waterfall chart labels** (15 min) - Chart is currently broken

### Phase 2: Navigation & Integration (Next)
4. **Link AI Workflow to Scenarios** (30 min) - Improve narrative flow
5. **Clarify logo requirements with user** (5 min) - Need user input
6. **Address AUC metric** (10 min) - Simple replacement

**Total Estimated Time**: ~2.5 hours for complete fix

---

## Implementation Approach

### Step 1: Create Fix Branches (Parallel)
- `fix/accessibility-purple-text`
- `fix/baseline-scenarios`
- `fix/chart-labels`
- `fix/workflow-integration`

### Step 2: Systematic Fixes
- Use Edit tool for surgical changes
- Test each fix in browser with screenshots
- Verify no regressions

### Step 3: Validation
- Check all 5 tabs visually
- Verify color compliance with grep
- Confirm no new violations introduced

## Questions for User

Before proceeding with fixes, I need your input on:

1. **Logo Requirements**:
   - Which logo(s) should I use?
   - Where is the logo file?
   - What's the desired placement?

2. **AUC Metric Decision**:
   - Remove, replace, move, or keep/reframe?
   - Preference?

3. **Baseline Values Approval**:
   - Are the proposed baseline values realistic for TeleVantage?
   - Should I adjust any numbers?

---

## Next Steps

Please review this plan and approve:
1. ✅ Purple text fixes (all 27 violations)
2. ✅ Baseline scenario fixes (realistic current state)
3. ✅ Chart label fixes (increase margin, horizontal labels)
4. ✅ AI Workflow enhancements (link to scenarios)
5. ❓ Logo implementation (need your input)
6. ❓ AUC metric decision (need your preference)

Once approved, I'll execute all fixes systematically using the orchestrator workflow.
