### 3. ✅ Fixed Waterfall Chart Labels
**Status**: COMPLETE
**File Modified**: WaterfallChart.tsx

**Changes**:
- Increased bottom margin from 60px → 90px (line 30)
- Changed labels from rotated -35° → horizontal (line 165)
- Changed text anchor from 'end' → 'middle' (line 165)
- Removed rotation transforms (removed dx, dy, transform attributes)

**Result**: All three column labels now fully visible:
- "Current Annual Turnover" → $9.78B
- "Retention Opportunity" → $2.20B
- "Optimized Turnover" → $7.58B ✅ (was missing before)

---

### 4. ✅ Fixed Unrealistic Baseline Scenarios
**Status**: COMPLETE
**File Modified**: ScenarioPlanner.tsx (3 scenarios)

**Changes**:

#### Scenario 1: Budget Optimization (lines 233-258)
**BEFORE (Unrealistic)**:
- Retention Budget: $0
- Customers Targeted: 0
- Annual Savings: $0
- ROI: n/a

**AFTER (Realistic)**:
- Label: "CURRENT STATE (Reactive Program)"
- Retention Budget: $75M (industry standard)
- Customers Targeted: 5.0M (10% of base, reactive)
- Annual Savings: $150M (current program performance)
- ROI: +100% (typical reactive program ROI)

#### Scenario 2: Contract Conversion (lines 391-416)
**BEFORE (Unrealistic)**:
- Conversion Rate: 0%
- Conversions: 0
- Annual Savings: $0
- ROI: n/a

**AFTER (Realistic)**:
- Label: "CURRENT STATE (Passive Conversion)"
- Conversion Rate: 5% (passive, no incentives)
- Conversions: 1.0M customers
- Churn Reduction: 130K/year
- Annual Savings: $45M
- ROI: +50%

#### Scenario 3: Onboarding Excellence (lines 543-568)
**BEFORE (Unrealistic)**:
- Churn Reduction: 0%
- Customers Saved: 0
- Annual Savings: $0
- 3-Year NPV: $0

**AFTER (Realistic)**:
- Label: "CURRENT STATE (Basic Onboarding)"
- Churn Reduction: 10% (minimal investment)
- Early Customers: 11.8M (0-3 months)
- Customers Saved: 470K/year
- Annual Savings: $168M
- 3-Year NPV: $450M

**Business Logic**: Baselines now represent current reactive/passive programs, making AI-driven improvements credible and measurable

---

### 5. ✅ Verification Complete
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Screenshots Captured**:
- fixes-verified-header-logo.png - Shows Kearney logo + white "Below Industry Avg" text
- Dashboard with fixed waterfall chart showing all 3 labels including $7.58B

**Verification Results**:
- ✅ Logo visible and professional
- ✅ No purple text on dark backgrounds
- ✅ All chart labels readable
- ✅ Baselines show realistic current state values

## Remaining Optional Enhancements

### 6. ⏳ AUC Metric on Dashboard (User Decision Needed)
**Current State**: "Prediction Accuracy (AUC) 85.0%" visible on Executive Dashboard
**User Question**: "Prediction Accuracy (AUC) ON THE DASHBOARD??"

**Options**:
A. Remove entirely (too technical for C-suite)
B. Replace with "Intervention Success Rate: 72%" (more actionable)
C. Move to Analytics tab (keep for technical audience)
D. Keep but reframe as "Model Confidence" with business explanation

**Recommendation**: Option B - Replace with business metric
**Rationale**: Executives care about outcomes, not ML metrics

**Status**: Awaiting user preference

---

### 7. ⏳ Link AI Workflow to Scenarios (Enhancement)
**Current State**: AI Workflow tab exists, Scenario Planner has "View AI Workflow" buttons
**User Feedback**: "NOT AT ALL LINKED TO THE SCENARIOS"

**Current Implementation**:
- ScenarioPlanner.tsx has slide-out panel (lines 651-780)
- Panel shows scenario-specific agent descriptions
- Dynamically updates based on activeScenario state

**Proposed Enhancements**:
1. Add "View Live Examples in Scenario Planner" buttons on AI Workflow tab
2. Show real scenario numbers in agent output examples
3. Add visual flow diagram connecting agents to scenario outcomes
4. Create cross-tab navigation (click scenario name → jump to Scenario Planner)

**Status**: Implementation ready, awaiting user approval
