## Persona 1: Chief Financial Officer (CFO) - Sarah Chen

**Probability: 35%**

### Profile
- **Name:** Sarah Chen
- **Role:** Chief Financial Officer, TeleVantage
- **Experience:** 15 years in telecom finance, MBA from Wharton
- **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Annual budget allocation ($2.1B operational budget)
  - ROI validation for strategic initiatives
  - Risk assessment and financial forecasting
  - Board-level financial reporting
- **Technical Proficiency:** High business acumen, moderate technical literacy
- **Decision Criteria:** NPV, IRR, payback period, budget efficiency, risk-adjusted returns

### CFO's Review: Financial Viability & Investment Case

#### Overall Assessment: ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ (4.5/5)

> "This platform provides the financial clarity I need to justify a $312M investment to the board. The ROI modeling is sophisticated, but I have questions about sensitivity analysis and downside scenarios."

---

### ✅ Strengths from CFO Perspective

#### 1. **Clear Financial Impact Quantification** (5/5)
- **KPI Dashboard:** Immediate visibility to $1.42B annual churn cost and $312M opportunity
- **Waterfall Chart:** Shows clear path from $1.42B baseline → $312M savings → $1.11B optimized state
- **Annual Impact:** 22% churn reduction is quantified with precision
- **Board-Ready Metrics:** Hero cards with industry benchmarking

**CFO Quote:** *"The waterfall visualization is exactly what I need for my board presentation. It shows the before/after economics in a way that non-technical directors can grasp immediately."*

#### 2. **Sophisticated Scenario Planning** (4.5/5)
- **Tab 2: Three Interactive ROI Calculators:**
  - **Scenario A (Contract Conversion):** M2M → Annual contract economics with CAC analysis
  - **Scenario B (Onboarding Excellence):** Early churn reduction with time-to-value metrics
  - **Scenario C (Budget Optimization):** ROI curve showing diminishing returns at different investment levels

- **Global Economic Assumptions Panel:**
  - ARPU: $65/month (adjustable)
  - LTV: 36 months (customizable)
  - Gross Margin: 45% (realistic for telecom)
  - Discount Rate: 10% (standard WACC)

**CFO Quote:** *"The ability to model different budget levels and see the ROI curve is critical. I can now show the board that $50M investment yields 6.2x ROI, but $100M only yields 3.1x due to diminishing returns."*

#### 3. **Risk-Adjusted Segmentation** (4/5)
- **54 Customer Segments:** Tenure × Contract × Value Tier matrix
- **Risk Distribution:** Very High (8%), High (15%), Medium (37%), Low (40%)
- **Targeted Investment:** Focus on 23% high-risk customers who drive 68% of churn cost
- **Efficient Capital Allocation:** Avoid over-investing in low-risk segments

**CFO Quote:** *"The segment-level ROI breakdown lets me allocate budget efficiently. Why spend on 40% low-risk customers when 23% high-risk customers account for most losses?"*

#### 4. **Model Performance Transparency** (4.5/5)
- **85% AUC:** Industry-leading predictive power (vs. 70-75% industry average)
- **Model Zoo:** 6 models compared (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network, Gradient Boosting, SVM)
- **Calibration Plots:** Shows model accuracy is reliable for financial forecasting
- **Confusion Matrix:** 82% precision at optimal threshold

**CFO Quote:** *"The 85% AUC gives me confidence that this isn't overpromising. The calibration plot shows the model is honest about its predictions, which is critical for financial planning."*

#### 5. **Budget Optimization Curve** (5/5)
- **Tab 2, Scenario C:** Interactive ROI curve with optimal investment point clearly marked
- **Marginal Analysis:** Shows where additional $1 investment stops yielding positive returns
- **Sensitivity Testing:** Real-time recalculation as assumptions change
- **NPV Maximization:** Automatically identifies optimal budget allocation

**CFO Quote:** *"This is the most valuable feature for me. The optimal investment point ($62M) is data-driven, not a guess. I can defend this number to the board with confidence."*

---

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement (CFO Perspective)

#### 1. **Missing Sensitivity Analysis** (Priority: HIGH)
**Current State:** Single-point estimates for ROI
**CFO Need:** Monte Carlo simulation or tornado charts showing:
- What if ARPU declines by 10%?
- What if LTV is 30 months instead of 36?
- What if implementation costs are 20% higher than projected?

**Recommendation:**
```
Add "Sensitivity Analysis" sub-tab showing:
- Best case: $425M savings (95th percentile)
- Base case: $312M savings (50th percentile)
- Worst case: $187M savings (5th percentile)
- Key risk factors: ARPU volatility, implementation delays, model drift
```

**CFO Quote:** *"I need to show the board the range of outcomes, not just the expected value. What's our downside scenario if assumptions are off by 15%?"*

---

#### 2. **Insufficient Cash Flow Detail** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current State:** Annual aggregate savings ($312M/year)
**CFO Need:** Monthly cash flow breakdown:
- Upfront investment: When do we pay $62M?
- Savings ramp-up: Month-by-month savings realization
- Payback period: When do we break even?
- NPV calculation: What's the 5-year NPV at 10% discount rate?

**Recommendation:**
```
Add "Cash Flow Timeline" visualization:
- Month 0-3: Implementation phase (-$62M investment)
- Month 4-12: Ramp-up phase ($18M savings)
- Month 13-24: Steady state ($312M annual run rate)
- Cumulative NPV curve: Break-even at month 9
```

**CFO Quote:** *"Annual savings are nice, but I need to know when we break even. The board will ask, 'What's the payback period?' and I don't have a clear answer."*

---

#### 3. **Implementation Cost Breakdown Missing** (Priority: HIGH)
**Current State:** Assumes implementation costs are embedded in ROI calculations
**CFO Need:** Transparent cost breakdown:
- Technology investment: AI infrastructure, model deployment
- Personnel costs: Data science team, retention specialists
- Marketing spend: Campaign execution, customer outreach
- Operational overhead: Training, change management

**Recommendation:**
```
Add "Investment Breakdown" table:
- AI/ML Infrastructure: $12M (20%)
- Marketing Campaigns: $28M (45%)
- Personnel & Training: $15M (25%)
- Technology Integration: $7M (10%)
- TOTAL: $62M
```

**CFO Quote:** *"I can't approve a $62M budget without knowing where the money is going. Is this headcount, software licenses, or marketing spend?"*

---

#### 4. **Competitive Benchmarking Gaps** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current State:** Internal metrics only
**CFO Need:** Industry context:
- How does our 30% churn rate compare to Verizon (22%), AT&T (25%)?
- Is $312M savings realistic compared to peer initiatives?
- What did competitors achieve with similar programs?

**Recommendation:**
```
Add "Industry Benchmark" panel:
- TeleVantage Current: 30% churn (Rank: #7)
- Industry Leader (Verizon): 22% churn
- Industry Average: 27% churn
- Best-in-class ROI: 4.8x (T-Mobile's 2023 program)
- Our Projected ROI: 5.0x (above industry average)
```

**CFO Quote:** *"The board will ask, 'Are we being too optimistic?' I need to show that $312M is achievable based on what competitors have done."*

---

#### 5. **Risk Mitigation Strategy Absent** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current State:** Assumes 100% execution success
**CFO Need:** Contingency planning:
- What if model performance degrades from 85% to 75% AUC?
- What if customer response rate is 15% instead of 25%?
- What if competitors launch similar programs and saturate the market?

**Recommendation:**
```
Add "Risk Register" with mitigation plans:
- Model Drift Risk: Quarterly retraining, A/B testing
- Execution Risk: Phased rollout (test 5% → 25% → 100%)
- Market Risk: Differentiated messaging, price lock-ins
- Technology Risk: Vendor redundancy, cloud failover
```

**CFO Quote:** *"I want to invest, but I need a Plan B. What's our de-risking strategy if things don't go as planned?"*

---

### CFO's Final Verdict

**Investment Recommendation:** ✅ **APPROVE with Conditions**

**Conditions:**
1. Add sensitivity analysis showing best/worst case scenarios
2. Provide monthly cash flow timeline with break-even analysis
3. Detail the $62M investment breakdown by category
4. Include industry benchmarking to validate ROI assumptions
5. Develop risk mitigation plan with phased rollout

**CFO's Closing Statement:**
> "This platform has the financial rigor I need to justify a $312M opportunity to the board. The scenario planning and ROI curves are world-class. However, I need more transparency on downside risks, cash flow timing, and implementation costs before I can sign the check. Once those gaps are filled, this is a slam-dunk investment case."

**Confidence Level:** 85% (High, pending conditions)

### CMO's Review: Customer Retention Strategy & Execution

#### Overall Assessment: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

> "This is exactly what my team needs to move from reactive firefighting to proactive retention. The segment-level insights and AI-powered recommendations are game-changers for campaign design."

---

### ✅ Strengths from CMO Perspective

#### 1. **Actionable Segment Intelligence** (5/5)
- **Tab 5: Segment Explorer:** Interactive heatmap with 54 segments
  - **Tenure Bands:** 0-6 months, 7-12 months, 13-24 months, 25-48 months, 49+ months
  - **Contract Types:** Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year
  - **Value Tiers:** High ARPU, Medium ARPU, Low ARPU

- **Click-Through Insights:** Each segment shows:
  - Population size (e.g., 2.1M customers)
  - Churn probability (e.g., 68% for M2M, 0-6 months)
  - Recommended strategy (e.g., "Convert to annual contract with $50 discount")
  - Expected ROI per customer (e.g., $420 LTV recovery)

**CMO Quote:** *"The heatmap is brilliant. I can instantly see that M2M customers in 0-6 months are bleeding out at 68% churn. That's where I'll deploy my onboarding excellence campaign first."*

#### 2. **Prescriptive Retention Strategies** (5/5)
- **Segment-Specific Recommendations:** Not just "high risk," but "here's what to do"
  - **Example 1 (M2M, 0-6 months):** "Offer $50 discount to convert to annual contract within 30 days"
  - **Example 2 (1-Year, 7-12 months):** "Proactive support outreach, address pain points before renewal"
  - **Example 3 (2-Year, 49+ months):** "Loyalty rewards program, upgrade to premium tier"

- **Top 10 Churn Drivers (Tab 4C):**
  1. Contract Type (M2M = 4.2x higher churn than 2-Year)
  2. Tenure (0-6 months = 3.8x higher churn than 49+ months)
  3. Tech Support Calls (5+ calls = 2.9x higher churn)
  4. Payment Method (Paper billing = 1.8x higher churn)
  5. Senior Citizen (65+ = 1.6x higher churn)

**CMO Quote:** *"This tells me exactly where to focus my campaigns. Tech support calls are a red flag—I can now trigger retention outreach after the 3rd support ticket instead of waiting for the customer to churn."*

#### 3. **Real-Time Campaign ROI Modeling** (5/5)
- **Tab 2, Scenario A (Contract Conversion):**
  - Slider: "What % of M2M customers can we convert to annual contracts?"
  - Real-time output:
    - 20% conversion → $87M savings, 3.2x ROI
    - 35% conversion → $152M savings, 4.8x ROI
    - 50% conversion → $218M savings, 5.5x ROI

- **Tab 2, Scenario B (Onboarding Excellence):**
  - Slider: "How much can we reduce 0-6 month churn?" (68% → 45%)
  - Real-time output: Cohort LTV increases from $1,240 → $2,180 (+76%)

**CMO Quote:** *"I can now pitch my campaign to the CFO with confidence. If I achieve 35% contract conversion, we save $152M with a 4.8x ROI. That's better than most of our acquisition campaigns."*

#### 4. **AI-Powered Strategy Copilot** (4.5/5)
- **Tab 3: Natural Language Querying:**
  - Example queries:
    - "Which segments have the highest churn risk and are most profitable to save?"
    - "What's the ROI of targeting senior citizens with simplified billing?"
    - "Compare retention strategies for M2M vs. 2-Year contract customers."

- **Multi-Agent Analytics:**
  - **Knowledge Base:** 47.3M customers, 54 segments, top churn drivers
  - **Decision Tools:** Scenario evaluation, ROI calculation, segment prioritization
  - **Insights:** "High-ARPU M2M customers in 0-6 months yield 8.2x ROI if converted to annual contracts"

**CMO Quote:** *"The copilot is like having a data scientist on call 24/7. I can ask business questions in plain English and get actionable answers in seconds, not days."*

#### 5. **Integrated Customer Journey Insights** (4.5/5)
- **Churn Timeline Analysis:** Shows when customers are most vulnerable
  - **0-6 months:** 52% of all churn happens here (onboarding failure)
  - **11-13 months:** Spike at annual renewal (contract friction)
  - **25-27 months:** Second spike at 2-year renewal

- **Cross-Feature Interactions:**
  - Tech support calls + M2M contract = 78% churn (urgent intervention needed)
  - Senior citizen + paper billing = 62% churn (digital literacy barrier)
  - High ARPU + 5+ support calls = 71% churn (service quality issue)

**CMO Quote:** *"The timeline view shows me that month 6 is critical. I can now design a '100-day guarantee' program with proactive check-ins at day 30, 60, and 90 to reduce early churn."*

---

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement (CMO Perspective)

#### 1. **Missing Campaign Execution Details** (Priority: HIGH)
**Current State:** Strategic recommendations without tactical playbooks
**CMO Need:** Step-by-step campaign blueprints:
- Email templates, SMS copy, call scripts
- Channel mix (email 40%, SMS 30%, outbound call 20%, in-app 10%)
- Timing and frequency (e.g., "Reach out 14 days before renewal")
- A/B testing frameworks (test 3 offers, measure lift)

**Recommendation:**
```
Add "Campaign Playbook" sub-tab for each segment:
- Segment: M2M, 0-6 months, High ARPU
- Campaign: "Onboarding Excellence + Contract Conversion"
- Channels: Email (Day 7, 21, 45), SMS (Day 14, 35), Call (Day 30)
- Offer: "$50 discount + 3 months free premium support for annual contract"
- KPIs: 35% conversion rate, 45% churn reduction, 4.8x ROI
- A/B Test: Discount ($50 vs. $75) vs. Premium support (3 months vs. 6 months)
```

**CMO Quote:** *"I love the strategy, but my team needs tactical playbooks. What's the email subject line? When do we send it? What's the offer structure?"*

---

#### 2. **Customer Experience Journey Map Missing** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current State:** Churn risk scores without friction point diagnosis
**CMO Need:** UX/CX pain point mapping:
- Where are customers getting stuck? (e.g., billing confusion, tech support wait times)
- What triggers churn? (e.g., price increase, service outage, competitor offer)
- What delights customers? (e.g., proactive support, billing credits)

**Recommendation:**
```
Add "Customer Journey Map" visualization:
- Stage 1 (Onboarding): 52% churn (Pain: setup complexity, billing surprise)
- Stage 2 (Active Use): 18% churn (Pain: tech issues, poor support)
- Stage 3 (Renewal): 22% churn (Pain: price shock, contract lock-in)
- Stage 4 (Loyalty): 8% churn (Pain: competitive offers, stagnation)

For each pain point:
- Impact: % of customers affected
- Severity: Churn lift (e.g., +32% churn if billing surprise)
- Mitigation: CX improvement (e.g., proactive billing preview)
```

**CMO Quote:** *"I need to know *why* customers churn, not just *who* will churn. Is it price, service quality, or poor onboarding? That dictates my retention strategy."*

---

#### 3. **Competitive Intelligence Gaps** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current State:** Internal data only
**CMO Need:** Competitive context:
- Why are customers leaving us for Verizon/AT&T/T-Mobile?
- What retention offers are competitors running?
- How do our churn rates compare to industry benchmarks by segment?

**Recommendation:**
```
Add "Competitive Landscape" panel:
- Win/Loss Analysis:
  - Lost to Verizon: 32% (reason: better network coverage)
  - Lost to T-Mobile: 28% (reason: lower price)
  - Lost to AT&T: 21% (reason: bundle deals with DirecTV)
  - Switched to MVNO: 12% (reason: cost savings)
  - Unknown: 7%

- Competitor Offers:
  - Verizon: $200 switch bonus + device trade-in
  - T-Mobile: 50% off first 3 months
  - AT&T: HBO Max bundled free
```

**CMO Quote:** *"I can't design retention offers in a vacuum. If Verizon is offering $200 to switch, I need to counter with a compelling reason to stay."*

---

#### 4. **Personalization Engine Absent** (Priority: HIGH)
**Current State:** Segment-level strategies (54 segments)
**CMO Need:** Individual-level personalization:
- Customer #12345 has 78% churn risk → Send offer X via channel Y on date Z
- Dynamic offer optimization (test 5 offers, send best-performing one)
- Real-time trigger campaigns (e.g., "Customer just called support 3 times this week → Send retention offer")

**Recommendation:**
```
Add "Campaign Automation" feature:
- Customer ID: 12345
- Churn Risk: 78% (Very High)
- Segment: M2M, 0-6 months, High ARPU
- Recommended Action: Convert to annual contract
- Best Offer: $75 discount (based on A/B test results)
- Best Channel: Email (open rate: 68%) + SMS (click rate: 42%)
- Best Timing: Tuesday 10 AM (highest conversion time)
- Next Best Action: If no response in 7 days → Outbound call

Export to Marketing Automation:
- Integrate with Salesforce Marketing Cloud
- Integrate with Braze for push notifications
- Integrate with Twilio for SMS campaigns
```

**CMO Quote:** *"I need this to integrate with our marketing automation platform. Can I export a CSV of high-risk customers with recommended offers and push it to Salesforce?"*

---

#### 5. **Attribution Model Unclear** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current State:** ROI calculated at aggregate level
**CMO Need:** Campaign-level attribution:
- If churn drops from 30% to 23%, which campaigns drove the lift?
- How much credit does onboarding excellence get vs. contract conversion?
- What's the incremental lift of each touchpoint (email, SMS, call)?

**Recommendation:**
```
Add "Attribution Dashboard":
- Baseline Churn: 30% (no campaigns)
- Campaign Impact:
  - Onboarding Excellence: -4% churn (40% of total lift)
  - Contract Conversion: -3% churn (30% of total lift)
  - Proactive Support: -2% churn (20% of total lift)
  - Loyalty Rewards: -1% churn (10% of total lift)
- TOTAL LIFT: -10% churn (from 30% → 20%)

Multi-Touch Attribution:
- Email contributed: 35% of conversions
- SMS contributed: 28% of conversions
- Outbound calls contributed: 22% of conversions
- In-app messages contributed: 15% of conversions
```

**CMO Quote:** *"If I run 5 campaigns simultaneously, I need to know which ones are working so I can double down on winners and kill losers. Attribution is critical for budget allocation."*

---

---

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement (Analytics Director Perspective)

#### 1. **Data Provenance Documentation Missing** (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Current State:** Data exists in JSON files with no lineage
**Analytics Director Need:** Full data pipeline documentation:
- **Source Systems:** Where does raw data come from? (CRM, billing, support tickets)
- **ETL Process:** How is data cleaned, transformed, and aggregated?
- **Data Quality Checks:** Missing values, outliers, anomalies
- **Refresh Cadence:** How often is data updated? (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Versioning:** Can we track data changes over time?

**Recommendation:**
```

**Analytics Director Quote:** *"I can't deploy a model without knowing where the data came from. If the CFO asks, 'Is this data fresh?' or 'What's the error rate?', I need answers."*

#### 2. **Model Retraining Strategy Undefined** (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Current State:** Model is trained once, deployed forever
**Analytics Director Need:** MLOps roadmap:
- **Model Drift Monitoring:** When does performance degrade?
- **Retraining Cadence:** Quarterly, monthly, or event-triggered?
- **A/B Testing Framework:** How do we validate new models before deploying?
- **Rollback Plan:** If new model performs worse, how do we revert?

**Recommendation:**
```
Create docs/MLOPS_STRATEGY.md:

1. Model Monitoring (Daily):
   - Track AUC, precision, recall on holdout set
   - Alert if AUC drops below 80% (5% degradation)
   - Alert if churn rate drifts >10% from forecast

2. Retraining Schedule:
   - Quarterly retraining (January, April, July, October)
   - Event-triggered retraining if:
     - AUC drops below 80%
     - Major product launch (new contract types, pricing changes)
     - Competitive event (e.g., Verizon launches aggressive promotion)

3. A/B Testing Framework:
   - Champion/Challenger approach:
     - Champion: Current model (85% AUC)
     - Challenger: New model (retrained on latest data)
   - Test on 10% of population for 2 weeks
   - Promote if Challenger AUC > Champion + 2% AND precision improves

4. Rollback Plan:
   - Version control: Model v1.0, v1.1, v1.2 (saved in S3)
   - If Challenger underperforms, revert to Champion within 24 hours
   - Post-mortem: Analyze why new model failed (data quality? feature drift?)
```

**Analytics Director Quote:** *"Models decay over time. Customer behavior changes, competitors adapt, and our model becomes stale. Without a retraining strategy, we're flying blind."*

---

#### 3. **Fairness & Bias Testing Absent** (Priority: HIGH)
**Current State:** No analysis of model fairness across demographic groups
**Analytics Director Need:** Ethical AI validation:
- **Disparate Impact:** Does the model unfairly penalize protected classes (age, race, gender)?
- **Equal Opportunity:** Do false negative rates differ across groups?
- **Calibration by Group:** Is the model equally well-calibrated for seniors vs. non-seniors?

**Recommendation:**
```
Add Tab 4E: "Fairness & Bias Analysis"

Protected Attributes:
- Age: Senior Citizen (65+) vs. Non-Senior (<65)
- (Race/Gender not available in dataset—document this limitation)

Fairness Metrics:
- Disparate Impact Ratio (DIR):
  - Seniors: 62% flagged as high-risk
  - Non-Seniors: 48% flagged as high-risk
  - DIR = 48% / 62% = 0.77 (below 0.8 threshold → potential bias)

- Equal Opportunity:
  - False Negative Rate (Seniors): 18%
  - False Negative Rate (Non-Seniors): 15%
  - Difference: 3% (acceptable, but monitor)

- Calibration by Group:
  - Seniors: Well-calibrated (calibration error: 0.03)
  - Non-Seniors: Well-calibrated (calibration error: 0.02)

Mitigation:
- Re-weight training data to balance false negative rates
- Post-processing: Adjust threshold by group to equalize false negatives
- Monitor quarterly for drift in fairness metrics
```

**Analytics Director Quote:** *"The model flags 62% of seniors as high-risk vs. 48% of non-seniors. Is this because seniors genuinely churn more, or is the model biased? We need fairness audits before deploying at scale."*

---

#### 4. **Error Analysis & Edge Cases Missing** (Priority: HIGH)
**Current State:** Aggregate metrics only (85% AUC)
**Analytics Director Need:** Deep dive into model failures:
- **False Positives:** Which customers did we incorrectly flag as high-risk?
- **False Negatives:** Which churners did we miss, and why?
- **Edge Cases:** Are there segments where the model performs poorly?

**Recommendation:**
```
Add Tab 4F: "Error Analysis"

False Positive Deep Dive (3,800 cases):
- Top False Positive Segment: 2-Year contract, 49+ months, High ARPU
- Reason: Model over-weights "tech support calls" feature (loyal customers call support but don't churn)
- Mitigation: Add "loyalty tenure" feature to counterbalance support call signal

False Negative Deep Dive (2,900 cases):
- Top False Negative Segment: M2M, 7-12 months, Medium ARPU
- Reason: Model under-weights "competitor promotion" trigger (not in dataset)
- Mitigation: Add external data source tracking competitor offers (e.g., Verizon switch bonuses)

Low-Performance Segments (AUC < 75%):
- Segment: 1-Year contract, 13-24 months, Low ARPU
- AUC: 72% (below overall 85%)
- Root Cause: Small sample size (only 420K customers in this segment)
- Mitigation: Combine with adjacent segments or flag as "low confidence"

Edge Cases:
- B2B customers: Not in training data (only B2C)
- Prepaid plans: Different churn dynamics (excluded from model)
- International roaming: Feature not captured (data gap)
```

**Analytics Director Quote:** *"I need to know where the model breaks down. The 15% error rate (100% - 85% AUC) is hiding failures in specific segments that could erode trust if we over-rely on the model."*

---

#### 5. **Reproducibility & Code Documentation Gaps** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current State:** React app code is well-documented, but model training pipeline is opaque
**Analytics Director Need:** End-to-end reproducibility:
- **Training Code:** Python/R scripts used to train XGBoost model
- **Hyperparameters:** Learning rate, max depth, n_estimators, etc.
- **Data Splits:** How were train/validation/test sets created? (70/15/15?)
- **Random Seeds:** Can we reproduce the exact same model?

**Recommendation:**
```
Create src/ml-pipeline/ directory:

1. train_churn_model.py:
   - Load raw data: load_data('telco_churn_raw.csv')
   - Feature engineering: create_features() → contract_one_hot, tenure_bins
   - Train/test split: train_test_split(test_size=0.15, random_state=42)
   - Model training: XGBClassifier(learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=6, n_estimators=100)
   - Evaluation: roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba)
   - Save model: joblib.dump(model, 'xgboost_churn_v1.pkl')

2. requirements.txt:
   - xgboost==1.7.4
   - scikit-learn==1.2.2
   - pandas==1.5.3
   - numpy==1.24.2

3. README_ML_PIPELINE.md:
   - How to run training: python train_churn_model.py
   - Expected output: xgboost_churn_v1.pkl (85% AUC)
   - Reproducibility: Fixed random seed (42), pinned library versions
```

**Analytics Director Quote:** *"If I can't reproduce the model, I can't trust it. I need the training scripts, hyperparameters, and random seeds so my team can audit and extend the model."*

### Analytics Director's Final Verdict

**Technical Approval:** ✅ **APPROVE with Critical Fixes**

**Critical Fixes Required (Before Production):**
1. **Data Provenance Documentation** → Create DATA_DICTIONARY.md with source systems, ETL, quality checks
2. **MLOps Strategy** → Define model retraining cadence, drift monitoring, A/B testing framework
3. **Fairness & Bias Testing** → Audit disparate impact on senior citizens, document mitigation strategies

**High Priority Enhancements:**
4. **Error Analysis** → Deep dive into false positives/negatives, identify low-performance segments
5. **Reproducibility** → Share model training code, hyperparameters, and data splits

**Analytics Director's Closing Statement:**
> "The model performance is strong (85% AUC) and the application is production-ready from a software engineering standpoint. However, I need more transparency on data lineage, model retraining, and fairness before I'm comfortable deploying this at scale to 47.3M customers. These are not blockers, but they are critical for long-term sustainability and regulatory compliance (especially fairness testing). Once these gaps are filled, this is a world-class churn prediction platform."

**Confidence Level:** 80% (High, pending critical fixes)
